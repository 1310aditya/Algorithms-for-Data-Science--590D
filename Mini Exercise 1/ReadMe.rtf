# Implementing Reservoir Sampling

Reservoir Sampling
## Task:
Implement reservoir sampling when reservoir has size 1. Let the items from 1 to 100 appear one by one.

  - Report the item sampled in one run of the algorithm.
  - Repeat the algorithm for 1000 times and plot the number of times each element is selected.
  - Repeat the algorithm for 10000 times and plot the number of times each element is selected.
  - Repeat the algorithm for 100000 times and plot the number of times each element is selected.
